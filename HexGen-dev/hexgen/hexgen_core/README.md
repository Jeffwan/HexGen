## Features of HexGen
HexGen stands out for its exceptional handling of large-scale transformer models, offering flexibility and efficiency through its innovative features.

### Tensor Model Parallelism with Integrated Heterogeneous Communication
HexGen implements asymmetric tensor model parallelism in a heterogeneous environment, efficiently grouping GPUs for optimized computation. It incorporates the generation of heterogeneous communication groups, allowing for coordinated peer-to-peer communication and data management. A leader GPU node is selected within each tensor parallelism group to manage the broadcast operation of activations, ensuring efficient data distribution and reducing computational overhead.

### Pipeline Parallelism with Enhanced Communication Dynamics
The system aligns pipeline stages with the corresponding tensor parallelism groups, facilitating concurrent processing and improved throughput. In each pipeline stage, a leader GPU node is chosen to handle peer-to-peer communication between stages, streamlining the data transfer process. This integration of pipeline parallelism with advanced communication dynamics ensures smooth and efficient processing across different stages of the model.

### Fast Decoding Using Flash Attention
Incorporating Flash Attention, HexGen significantly enhances its decoding capabilities. This integration brings state-of-the-art efficiency to attention mechanism computations within transformer models, leading to faster and more effective processing.
